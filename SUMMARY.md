**Food Recognition 2022** is a dataset for semantic segmentation tasks. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the food and medical industries. 

The dataset consists of 43962 images with 95009 labeled objects belonging to 498 different classes including *water*, *salad-leaf-salad-green*, *bread-white*, and other: *tomato-raw*, *butter*, *carrot-raw*, *bread-wholemeal*, *coffee-with-caffeine*, *rice*, *egg*, *apple*, *mixed-vegetables*, *jam*, *cucumber*, *wine-red*, *cheese*, *banana*, *potatoes-steamed*, *bell-pepper-red-raw*, *espresso-with-caffeine*, *hard-cheese*, *bread-whole-wheat*, *tea*, *mixed-salad-chopped-without-sauce*, *avocado*, *white-coffee-with-caffeine*, *tomato-sauce*, *wine-white*, and 470 more.

Images in the Food Recognition 2022 dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the semantic segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into an object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. There are 3001 (7% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *validation* (1000 images), *training* (39962 images), and *test* (3000 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the [AIcrowd, Switzerland](https://www.aicrowd.com/).

Here is a visualized example for 25 randomly selected sample classes:

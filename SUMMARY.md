**Food Recognition 2022** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the food industry.

The dataset consists of 43962 images with 173329 labeled objects belonging to 996 different classes including *water*, *water_bbox*, *salad-leaf-salad-green*, and others.

Each image in the Food Recognition 2022 dataset has pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the semantic segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. There are 3001 (7% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (3000 images), *training* (39962 images), and *validation* (1000 images). The dataset was released in 2022.

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 996 classes:
